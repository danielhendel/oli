# Oli Health OS — Product Vision (v1)

## One-Sentence Definition

**Oli is a personal health operating system that makes health data trustworthy over time — so individuals can confidently live healthier lives without guessing, fragmentation, or silent failure.**

---

## The User We Serve (Phase 1)

Phase 1 of Oli is built for a **self-directed, health-literate individual** who treats their health as a long-term asset rather than a short-term goal.

This user:
- Already tracks parts of their health (e.g. weight, workouts, sleep, labs, nutrition)
- Is frustrated by:
  - fragmented apps
  - lost or overwritten history
  - silent failures
  - data that “looks fine” but cannot be trusted later
- Thinks in **years and decades**, not streaks, challenges, or trends
- Cares deeply about **design, clarity, and craftsmanship**, because these signal seriousness, reliability, and respect
- Expects the tools they rely on to feel **calm, deliberate, and excellent**

Phase 1 is not designed for mass-market convenience or coaching.  
It is designed for people who value **truth, continuity, and quality** — and are willing to invest effort in exchange for trust.

---

## The Core Promise (Non-Negotiable)

> **Oli will never leave you guessing about your health data.**

This promise governs all product, design, and engineering decisions.

It means:
- Data is correct when possible
- Missing or incomplete data is explicit
- Failures are visible, preserved, and explainable
- Success feels decisive and final
- Silence is never used to imply correctness

“Correctness” alone is not sufficient.  
**Trust must be experienced.**

---

## Integrity Includes Excellence

In Oli, integrity is not limited to data correctness.

Integrity includes:
1. **Truth integrity** — history is preserved, not rewritten
2. **Transparency integrity** — uncertainty and failure are visible
3. **Experiential integrity** — the system behaves reliably and predictably

For the Phase 1 user:
- Flakiness creates doubt
- Ambiguity erodes trust
- Sloppy or confusing UI signals carelessness

Because this user takes their health seriously, **the product must reflect that seriousness through exceptional reliability and a calm, beautiful experience**.

“It just works” is not convenience — it is integrity made tangible.

---

## Phase 1: What “Done” Means

Phase 1 is complete when:

- A user can build a **durable personal health record** over time
- Health data flows correctly from ingestion → normalization → derived truth
- Failures, missing data, and uncertainty are **explicit and visible**
- Nothing silently breaks, disappears, or rewrites history
- The product feels:
  - stable
  - intentional
  - trustworthy
  - calm

Phase 1 does **not** aim to optimize outcomes, recommend actions, or coach behavior.  
It aims to establish a foundation that makes those things possible later.

---

## What Oli Is Not (Explicit Non-Goals)

In Phase 1, Oli is **not**:

- A coaching app
- A motivation or habit tracker
- A social or gamified health product
- A chatbot-first experience
- A wearable-first dashboard
- A content platform

These are downstream possibilities — not starting points.

---

## Long-Term Direction (Without Commitment)

By consistently keeping its core promise over time, Oli becomes more than an app.

Oli becomes the **trusted substrate for healthy living**:
- A complete and durable personal health record
- A foundation others can safely build on (tools, professionals, systems)
- A place where health value compounds instead of resetting

Oli’s ecosystem emerges **because trust compounds**, not because features accumulate.

---

## How This Vision Should Be Used

This document is authoritative.

It should be used to:
- Resolve product debates
- Constrain feature scope
- Guide design decisions
- Ground AI-assisted development
- Prevent drift toward convenience at the expense of trust

If a proposed change would cause users to guess, doubt, or double-check their health data, it violates this vision.
